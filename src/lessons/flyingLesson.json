            "content": "The controller features two joysticks, with the left joystick responsible for vertical movement and rotation. Pushing the left joystick up causes the drone to ascend, while pulling it down results in descent. Moving the left joystick left or right causes the drone to pivot around its vertical axis without changing its position on the ground. he right joystick controls horizontal movement; pushing it forward makes the drone move in that direction, while pulling it back makes it move backward. Moving the right joystick left or right directs the drone to move laterally in those respective directions. A combination of both joysticks is essential for maneuvering the drone effectively and capturing high-quality footage."

            "content": "Most drone controllers include a gimbal control feature, typically located in the upper left corner of the controller. The gimbal can be adjusted to tilt from straight ahead to directly downward, with some advanced models allowing for a tilt beyond 90 degrees. Many new drones are equipped with gimbals that can point slightly upward, enhancing the range of shooting angles. Some controllers allow for a full 360-degree rotation of the gimbal, providing even greater versatility in capturing images and videos. The gimbal control is often a jog wheel that can be manipulated to change the angle of the camera quickly, depending on the pressure applied. Users can customize gimbal settings through software to adjust the speed of the gimbal movements for smoother footage."
